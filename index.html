      So long, Glitch. You made a lasting impact on the lives of many people.
      Whether that is in the classroom, to the childhood of a programmer, you
      did that. There is even goodbye-glitch.js that is in this project that was made for you. Open the console to see it.

        Thank you, Glitch! Everyone there made programming awesome. The code
        jams were a fun way to see how other people programmed, and I also got
        to meet some awesome people. It was always an honor to have the "glitch"
        in the URL. It also was great to read in the README the part that said
        "you built this with Glitch." I read that so many times.

        Goodbye Glitch! I‚Äôve been a user of Glitch since it was called Gomix,
        way back in 2016! It was maybe the easiest way to edit code and get an
        app or website online. It abstracted away the devops side, so you could
        ignore that if you wanted, and the remixing and sharing philosophies
        were hugely important. I found a lot of interesting people on twitter
        and bluesky through their Glitch apps. My biggest successes were ‚ÄúHarry
        Styles Heardle‚Äù and ‚ÄúLinkedin Besties‚Äù, both of which went viral on
        Tiktok, but I love all of my 190-ish apps, of which I‚Äôm migrating about
        60 to live on new platforms.

        Glitch was my childhood (probably not the right thing to be doing as a
        kid, instead of going out and making friends) and seeing it shutdown is
        like when your parents take away that one teddy bear for washing and
        you never see it again. It hurts, but eventually you accept the pain
        and move onto other teddy bears. Jokes aside, it takes a lot of courage
        to admit that things aren‚Äôt working and end on a pleasant note, before
        the experience gets terrible for users and Glitch doesn‚Äôt have a unique
        reputation anymore.
        <br /><br />
        glitch was like my first love - unfortunately they‚Äôre both over so im
        happy it happened. thanks for all the memories, tutorials, Twitch
        streams, and cool people.

        This is heartbreaking. Glitch played a huge role in my programming
        journey back in middle and high schools, and now I‚Äôm entering my third

        Glitch has been an incredible tool for my coding development. I don‚Äôt
        remember when I started, but I‚Äôve loved Glitch forever. Thank you for
        such an amazing way to share, build, and experience the web in a way
        that no other place has given me. I remember the first (and only)
        CodeJam I participated in-- it was about bugs, and I spent multiple
        days straight coding it up for fun. It‚Äôs a very sad time seeing this
        happen, and I‚Äôm really gonna miss it. Glitch, thank you-- For
        everything.

        Glitch used to be the best hosting platform I‚Äôve ever
        experienced‚Äîfree, powerful, and truly wonderful. It had a unique charm
        that made coding feel effortless. Now, with its absence, I can‚Äôt help
        but feel a sense of loss. Replit, CodeSandbox, and the rest just don‚Äôt
        compare. It‚Äôs a bittersweet reminder of what once was.

        Hi Glitch, I don‚Äôt want you to leave, throughout my time of
        depression, I spent my time coding and developing websites, and you
        were the only one I used. You are easy, You don‚Äôt cost anything, You
        gave Joy, You gave Opportunity, and You gave Memories. You are more of
        a Perfect Person than most people will ever be, I just wish you could
        stay alive, maybe the cure could be a donation link, a subscription,
        idk, just anything, anything that could fix this. Please don‚Äôt leave
        me, please. I‚Äôd even be willing to pay a little subscription. I luv u,
        think about it, please, I believe there‚Äôs a solution, so please I beg.
        - Stay. With. Me. Pweeze?

        I hosted several web-game forks and other various personal projects of
        mine on Glitch throughout the years. It‚Äôs a surreal feeling watching
        Glitch go away - feels like just yesterday I was 9 years old, screwing
        around with JavaScript like nobody‚Äôs business. If you do the math,
        you‚Äôll realize that Glitch has been a big part of my life to this
        point. It sucks‚Ä¶it really sucks. It certainly won‚Äôt be easy to move on
        - especially in finding alternatives where they‚Äôll inevitably be needed
        - but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll live.
        <br /><br />
        I understand why this decision was made, though, and I understand that
        the service life of Glitch has unfortunately run its course. All things
        do, and a decade is usually enough to do it in here in cyberspace.
        However, I cannot help but feel emotional as I watch one of the major
        foundations of my life‚Äôs work finally ride off into the sunset. It‚Äôs
        just one of those things, I guess.
        <br /><br />
        Glitch has done me an incredible service over the 7 years I‚Äôve spent on
        the platform, meeting the various needs I‚Äôve had in that span of time.
        To the Glitch team I cannot be more thankful for the opportunity to do
        some of the crazy things I‚Äôve done in these many years. Without Glitch,
        it simply could not have been done.
        <br /><br />
        What I‚Äôll do now? Nobody knows. What I do know is that Glitch will
        forever hold a special place in my heart as the place it all started.
        It‚Äôs been real - it‚Äôs been fun - hell, perhaps it really has been real
        fun. To greener pastures, I suppose. Farewell, Glitch. From the bottom
        of my heart (or what little remains thereof), thank you for everything.

        Goodbye, Glitch. My friend introduced me to Glitch in 2023. I loved
        game scripting, and Glitch introduced me to web development for the
        very first time. It was enjoyable learning to develop my web projects
        by putting together pieces of code and formatting to see what they did
        almost instantly. Glitch has been my safe place on the internet for
        over 2 years now, and I sure will miss how easy it was. Now, I thank
        Glitch for their years of service and the convenience of not just me,
        but many others as well. Once again, and for the last time: Goodbye,

        Been a Glitch user since 2020 when I found it in a YouTube tutorial for
        making a Discord bot, and quickly became hooked on this incredible
        platform that let me make all the useless web projects I could think
        of. In lockdown I spent way too much time on this forum and the Discord
        server interacting with the cool people in the community, pretty
        bittersweet to see some of the names that I remember again now that the
        site is shutting down. I will always look back on Glitch with fond
        memories and gratitude for the passion for coding it sparked in me.. bye

        I‚Äôve been a glitch user since, checks api, 2018! I started out
        following a guide to run discord bots which is long since outdated now.
        Glitch was an awesome platform because it was so easy to get into. I
        could easily spin up a project and start coding without having to
        install anything, or know about how node worked. The ability to edit at
        the same time was kick ass and made it super easy to work with other
        when we didn‚Äôt know what git was. It had a super understanding
        community which helped me through my super dumb questions, and is
        probably what got me in the door to be the programmer I am today.
        <br /><br />
        Even though I don‚Äôt use glitch these days (haven‚Äôt for a few years), it
        still holds a very special place in my heart, and I‚Äôm sad to see it go.
        Thank you glitch and the community for everything.

        I‚Äôve been a Glitch user since 2019. It had been my very first
        introduction to web development. From the very start, the community was
        nothing but helpful, kind, and simply fun. Glitch has 100% inspired
        countless amounts of people to continue computer science, from random
        projects and discord bots of lockdown to now much more. Thank you,
        Glitch, for inspiring me, and many others.
        <br /><br />
        P.S. Glitch will always have a special place to me as I look at the
        many names that were once so active. How it brought developers together
        was like none other, and I doubt that there will ever be a replacement
        for it. Goodbye, Glitch.

        Glitch was perfect for me as a budding developer. It was the best of the 
        very few hosting sites accessible to me, and I have developed (pun intended) 
        many fond memories over the 4-5 years I used this site. I‚Äôm really sad to see glitch end, 
        and thankfully I‚Äôm able to keep the memory alive by downloading my many projects, completed or half-finished. 
        Goodbye Glitch!!!

        Back in the early days of me trying to program some websites, Lameplit 
        was my pick. When they turned off their signature ‚ÄúAlways On‚Äù, I started 
        working more on Glitch. Now that Glitch is slowly and painfully ending too, 
        I don‚Äôt know where to go. I guess it was great having my websites on the internet, 
        but for now, free dynamic internet hosting that isn‚Äôt plain sketchy PHP hosters, 
        is dead. Glitch was my love, like my second Lameplit. But it seems every great 
        service I love ends in the 2020s, like Skype or Lameplit itself. Anyways, I won‚Äôt 
        bother too much with this absolute poetry, I just want to say: rest in peace, Glitch. 
        You will be missed.
