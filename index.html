Well... This is hard.

I know I already said this, and that I am sad, blah, blah, blah, but I really am very sad. 
I kind of knew this was coming. I mean, the signs were clear, but it still came out of
nowhere, and it hurts. Really bad. I met tons of programmers here, but here it is,
coming to an end. 

Goodbye, everybody.

    So long, Glitch. You made a lasting impact on the lives of many people. Whether that is in the classroom, to the childhood of a programmer, you did that.

        Thank you, Glitch! Everyone there made programming awesome. The code jams were a fun way to see how other people programmed, and I also got to meet some awesome people. It was always an honor to have the "glitch" in the URL. It also was great to read in the README the part that said "you built this with Glitch." I read that so many times. <br />

Goodbye Glitch! I’ve been a user of Glitch since it was called Gomix, way back in 2016!
It was maybe the easiest way to edit code and get an app or website online.
It abstracted away the devops side, so you could ignore that if you wanted, and the remixing and sharing philosophies were hugely important.
I found a lot of interesting people on twitter and bluesky through their Glitch apps.
My biggest successes were “Harry Styles Heardle” and “Linkedin Besties”, both of which went viral on Tiktok, but I love all of my 190-ish apps, of which I’m migrating about 60 to live on new platforms.

        Glitch was my childhood (probably not the right thing to be doing as a kid, instead of going out and making friends) and seeing it shutdown is like when your parents take away that one teddy bear for washing and you never see it again. It hurts, but eventually you accept the pain and move onto other teddy bears. Jokes aside, it takes a lot of courage to admit that things aren’t working and end on a pleasant note, before the experience gets terrible for users and Glitch doesn’t have a unique reputation anymore.

glitch was like my first love - unfortunately they’re both over so im happy it happened. thanks for all the memories, tutorials, Twitch streams, and cool people.        <div class="name">— Khalby786 - Since 2019</div>

        This is heartbreaking. Glitch played a huge role in my programming journey back in middle and high schools, and now I’m entering my third year of studying computer science in university.

Met so many kind and brilliant people here (shoutout to @khalby786 @aboutdavid @javaarchive @EddiesTech) and staff (@jenn @tasha).

I send my best wishes to the team; Glitch will always hold a special place in my heart.

Glitch has been an incredible tool for my coding development. I don’t remember when I started, but I’ve loved Glitch forever.
Thank you for such an amazing way to share, build, and experience the web in a way that no other place has given me.
I remember the first (and only) CodeJam I participated in-- it was about bugs, and I spent multiple days straight coding it up for fun.
It’s a very sad time seeing this happen, and I’m really gonna miss it.
Glitch, thank you-- For everything.     <div class="name">—

        Glitch used to be the best hosting platform I’ve ever experienced—free, powerful, and truly wonderful. It had a unique charm that made coding feel effortless. Now, with its absence, I can’t help but feel a sense of loss. Replit, CodeSandbox, and the rest just don’t compare. It’s a bittersweet reminder of what once was.

Hi Glitch, I don’t want you to leave, throughout my time of depression, I spent my time coding and developing websites, and you were the only one I used. You are easy, You don’t cost anything, You gave Joy, You gave Opportunity, and You gave Memories. You are more of a Perfect Person than most people will ever be, I just wish you could stay alive, maybe the cure could be a donation link, a subscription, idk, just anything, anything that could fix this. Please don’t leave me, please. I’d even be willing to pay a little subscription. I luv u, think about it, please, I believe there’s a solution, so please I beg. - Stay. With. Me. Pweeze?     <div class="name">—

I hosted several web-game forks and other various personal projects of mine on Glitch throughout the years. It’s a surreal feeling watching Glitch go away - feels like just yesterday I was 9 years old, screwing around with JavaScript like nobody’s business. If you do the math, you’ll realize that Glitch has been a big part of my life to this point. It sucks…it really sucks. It certainly won’t be easy to move on - especially in finding alternatives where they’ll inevitably be needed - but I’m sure I’ll live.
<br />
I understand why this decision was made, though, and I understand that the service life of Glitch has unfortunately run its course. All things do, and a decade is usually enough to do it in here in cyberspace. However, I cannot help but feel emotional as I watch one of the major foundations of my life’s work finally ride off into the sunset. It’s just one of those things, I guess.
<br />
Glitch has done me an incredible service over the 7 years I’ve spent on the platform, meeting the various needs I’ve had in that span of time. To the Glitch team I cannot be more thankful for the opportunity to do some of the crazy things I’ve done in these many years. Without Glitch, it simply could not have been done.
<br />
What I’ll do now? Nobody knows. What I do know is that Glitch will forever hold a special place in my heart as the place it all started. It’s been real - it’s been fun - hell, perhaps it really has been real fun. To greener pastures, I suppose.
<br />
Farewell, Glitch. From the bottom of my heart (or what little remains thereof), thank you for everything. <div class="name">—

I’ve been a Glitch user since late 2019. Back then, I was just beginning to discover the world of programming. Then I stumbled upon Glitch, a beautifully designed platform that brought developers together in one place, allowing us to share our work and ideas freely.

Though I haven’t used Glitch much in recent years, it played a meaningful role in my journey. It inspired me to keep building, to teach others, and to give back to the community.

It’s bittersweet to see it go. But I’m truly grateful for the time I spent here, for the opportunity to learn, to create, and to be part of something special.

Thank you for creating, supporting, and inspiring an entire generation of makers.

Thank you, Glitch.

Been in here since '18. I remember when I started out, I wanted to try out making node apps, in particular a Discord bot for my own community(ies). This platform was the only one I found then that was friendly and safe enough for me and I don’t think there’s anything else close to it. I may have slowly stopped using it lately, but without it I probably would’ve had a hard time getting as interested in the Node ecosystem as I am now (and to an extent databasing…!) It hurts a little, not gonna lie, but I am grateful for all it has provided me in the years I was deep into learning, and to an extent even now.
